## :fire: Features

### :rocket: Blazing quick setup

Deploy in minutes: everything is set up in `gatsby-config.js`.

See [Setup](#zap-setup) for instructions.

### :trophy: Lighthouse scores

Performance is only hindered by Google Fonts being hosted on Google's CDN.

If you don't need to dynamically change typefaces, consider self-hosting webfonts. I recommend [typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) by Kyle Matthews.

### :abc: Built-in Google Fonts support

The Google Font(s) you choose in `gatsby-config.js` will be dynamically imported from Google's CDN.

### :nail_care: CSS3 background patterns

Choose from a selection of [CSS3 background patterns](https://github.com/LeaVerou/css3patterns) by Lea Verou.

The available patterns can be found [here](https://gatsby-starter-under-construction.netlify.com/patterns)

### :link: Social links

Dynamically render social icons with Jake Trent's [react-social-icons](https://github.com/jaketrent/react-social-icons).

### :dizzy: Transitions

Transitions on page rendering with `react-transition-group`.
